------------------------------------------------------------CONCEPTION---------------------------------------------------------

No modification was made to the original architecture.
Added extensions : visual animations : arms up when the cyclist reaches the finish line and cycling-feet animations ; slippery terrain ; 

gravity wells ; seesaws ; pendulums ;  2 levels ( but without transition) ; triggers ; finish ; checkpoints ; “boost” key on the bike which promptly accelerates the bike.


Added components :
-	Boost  : when “B” key on keyboard is pressed the bike accelerates promptly .This function is needed for some parts of the game 
-	Trigger : we added a class called trigger with all the elements that can interact with the bike (keys to open the door to unlock next level, finishline
	and checkPoints that let you respawn at certain points)

-	Gravity Field : in both of our levels, we added gravity fields that switch the gravity temporarily
	and let us hover upstairs or downstairs

-	Pendulum : we created two kinds of pendulums : the first must be avoided by the bike because otherwise it will destroy it,  
	the other one acts like a platform and let’s you go from one point to another. Both are implemented in the first level of the game

-	Seesaw :  two consecutive seesaws are implemented in the end of the second level

-	Slippery terrain :  in the middle of the first level a slippery “slope” got added ,you will have to use the boost to get over
	 this polyline with very low friction

-	Animations of biker : two animations have been added to the biker: the fact that he raises his hands when he touches the finishline and the "cycling" with 
	his legs
