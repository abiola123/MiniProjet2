-------------------------------------------------------------------BIKE GAME-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bike Game is an arcade type mountain bike game whose goal is to show you many kinds of applications of java and jbox2d

1.How to run the program :

To run the programe you can either : 1. Import all the files into your favorite editor (like eclipse) and use the console to run the class "program" of the game

				     2. Use a terminal and run the file "program.java" 

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of our goals when creating this game , was to make it as easy to use as possible. That is why the controls that we used are very basic and natural.


2.How to navigate through the game:

-Use "ARROW-UP" to accelerate

-Use "ARROW-DOWN" to break

-Use "ARROW-LEFT" and "ARROW-RIGHT" to balance the bike in the respective directions

-Use "SPACE" to change directions

-Use "B" to utilize the hidden boost function that gives your bike a speed boost when needed


//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. LEVELS 
We decided to implement two different levels in our game :

-The first level is an unidirectional type of level, you have to use the boost button several times and at the end of the level is a closed door that 
opens only if you collect all the keys that are on your way. This door allows you to go the next level
There are two checkpoints so if you die you will respawn there automatically.
Be careful not to hit object with any other part than your bikes, otherwise you will die.

hint : do not rush the level, if you go too fast you will miss some of the keys and will have to start again


-The second level plays more with the vertical aspect of the game, you will have to use gravityfields to go up and down, overcome obstacles 
like seasaws and you will to have to be very careful if you want to master this difficult level.

hint : the gravityfields may seem hard to overcome on the beginning, but again don't rush your way through the game and everything will be fine   

 


enjoy!
